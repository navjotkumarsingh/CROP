    <p>Cotton farming is a cornerstone of global agriculture, playing a pivotal role in the textile industry and the livelihoods of millions of farmers worldwide. Known as "white gold," cotton is a versatile crop that provides raw material for countless products, from clothing and textiles to medical supplies and industrial goods...</p>

    <p>The cultivation of cotton is a meticulous process that requires careful planning, resource management, and adaptability to environmental conditions. It begins with the selection of suitable land, as cotton thrives in well-drained, fertile soils with a pH range of 5.8 to 8.0...</p>

    <p>The planting phase is critical, as the timing and method of sowing can significantly impact yield. Cotton seeds are typically sown at a depth of 2-3 cm, with spacing tailored to the variety and local conditions...</p>

    <p>Weed control is another crucial aspect of cotton farming, as weeds compete with cotton plants for nutrients, water, and sunlight. Farmers employ a combination of mechanical, cultural, and chemical methods to manage weeds effectively...</p>

    <p>Harvesting marks the culmination of the cotton farming process. The crop is harvested when the bolls open and the fibers are fully mature. In many regions, harvesting is still done manually, which is labor-intensive but allows for better quality control...</p>

    <p>Cotton farming is not without its challenges. Climate change, water scarcity, and soil degradation pose significant threats to production...</p>
