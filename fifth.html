    <h1>Soil Types and Their Importance</h1>

    <h2>1. Alluvial Soil</h2>
    <img src="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sunil-Kumar-Yadav-8/publication/321354520/figure/fig1/AS:571941768892417@1511904440907/Alluvial-soil-sample.png" alt="Alluvial Soil">
    <p>This fertile soil is mostly found in river valleys and deltas. It supports crops like rice, wheat, sugarcane, and pulses. It is rich in potash and ideal for agriculture due to its water retention capacity.</p>

    <h2>2. Black Soil</h2>
    <img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/84/148784-050-FA8B87E4/black-soil-field.jpg" alt="Black Soil">
    <p>Black soil, also known as Regur soil, is ideal for cotton cultivation and found in the Deccan plateau. It retains moisture and becomes sticky when wet, but cracks open when dry, allowing better aeration.</p>

    <h2>3. Red Soil</h2>
    <img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/28/151028-050-F2CB439E/red-soil.jpg" alt="Red Soil">
    <p>Formed from weathered igneous and metamorphic rocks, red soil is rich in iron but poor in nitrogen. It is commonly used for growing groundnut, millet, and pulses in southern and eastern India.</p>

    <h2>4. Laterite Soil</h2>
    <img src="https://www.agrifarming.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Laterite-Soil.jpg" alt="Laterite Soil">
    <p>This soil forms in tropical and subtropical regions with high rainfall. It is rich in iron and aluminum but poor in fertility, often requiring fertilizers. Laterite soil is suitable for tea, coffee, and cashew cultivation.</p>

    <h2>5. Arid Soil</h2>
    <img src="https://www.mapsofindia.com/my-india/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Arid-Soil.jpg" alt="Arid Soil">
    <p>Found in Rajasthan and Gujarat, arid soil is sandy and lacks moisture and humus. It is saline in nature but can be productive with proper irrigation. Pearl millet and barley are often grown here.</p>

    <h2>6. Forest Soil</h2>
    <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.j2UMuNqKZ2xC3cJ8ck49RgHaE8?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain" alt="Forest Soil">
    <p>Located in hilly and mountainous regions, forest soil is rich in organic matter and supports temperate fruits, tea, and spices. Its composition varies depending on the forest type and climate.</p>

    <h2>Soil Conservation Techniques</h2>
    <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.U9T2osVOP8aKMf4EoEv3ugHaE8?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain" alt="Soil conservation methods">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Contour Plowing:</strong> Reduces runoff by plowing along land contours.</li>
      <li><strong>Terracing:</strong> Creates flat platforms on slopes to reduce erosion.</li>
      <li><strong>Cover Cropping:</strong> Uses crops to protect soil from erosion and improve fertility.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Soil Fertility Management</h2>
    <p>Managing soil fertility involves maintaining nutrient balance through organic and inorganic fertilizers. Techniques include composting, crop rotation, and green manure to ensure long-term productivity and sustainability.</p>
