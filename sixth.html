    <h1>Cultivation Techniques</h1>

    <h2>1. Traditional Methods</h2>
    <img src="https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/traditional-way-cultivation-asia-india-bangladesh-farmer-ploughing-soil-rice-plants-clay-ox-antiquated-method-246738171.jpg" alt="Traditional farming">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Subsistence Farming:</strong> Growing crops primarily for personal consumption.</li>
      <li><strong>Shifting Cultivation:</strong> Clearing a piece of land, using it for farming, and then moving to another area once the soil loses fertility.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Modern Techniques</h2>
    <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.5siQYqZtvyGpkHo7TdM0agHaEK?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain" alt="Modern farming technology">
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Aeroponics:</strong> Growing plants in an air or mist environment without soil.</li>
      <li><strong>Hydroponics:</strong> Cultivating plants in nutrient-rich water instead of soil.</li>
      <li><strong>Vertical Farming:</strong> Using stacked layers to grow crops in controlled environments.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Specialized Methods</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Terrace Farming:</strong> Creating stepped levels on hillsides to prevent soil erosion and grow crops.</li>
      <li><strong>Mixed Farming:</strong> Combining crop cultivation with livestock farming.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Plowing</h2>
    <img src="https://www.agrivi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Stubble-Cultivation.jpg" alt="Tractor plowing field">
    <p>Plowing is the process of turning over the soil to prepare it for planting. It improves aeration, mixes organic matter, and helps roots access nutrients. Farmers use tools like plows or tractors to break up compacted soil. This technique is essential for crops like wheat and rice, ensuring healthy growth and higher yields.</p>

    <h2>Crop Rotation</h2>
    <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.uSkrZGShyo06TQmQKZ06igHaDK?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain" alt="Crop rotation concept">
    <p>Crop rotation involves alternating crops in the same field to maintain soil fertility and reduce pests. For example, planting legumes one season and cereals the next enriches the soil with nitrogen. This sustainable practice minimizes the risk of soil depletion and improves overall productivity.</p>

    <h2>Intercropping</h2>
    <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.aCGHZIxmQtKWKzu2ENVTyAHaEF?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain" alt="Intercropping">
    <p>Intercropping is the cultivation of two or more crops together in the same field. For instance, maize and beans are often grown together, as beans fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting maize growth. This technique maximizes land use and enhances biodiversity.</p>

    <h2>Hydroponics</h2>

    <p>Hydroponics is a modern farming method where plants grow without soil, using nutrient-rich water solutions. It is ideal for urban areas with limited space. Crops like lettuce and herbs thrive in hydroponic systems, offering efficient and sustainable food production.</p>

    <h2>Aeroponics</h2>
    <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.dCp-L5WTmNZjfOeWa6X7mAHaEK?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain" alt="Aeroponics farming">
    <p>Aeroponics involves growing plants in an air or mist environment without soil. This technique uses minimal water and is highly efficient for crops like leafy greens. It is particularly useful in controlled environments, such as space missions.</p>

    <h2>Vertical Farming</h2>
    <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.qXfPq7yoNqJSYTmD_7MoTwHaED?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain" alt="Vertical farming layers">
    <p>Vertical farming utilizes stacked layers to grow crops in controlled environments. This method optimizes space and resources, making it ideal for urban areas. Vegetables like spinach and kale are commonly grown in vertical farms.</p>

    <h2>Permaculture</h2>
    <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.VXddRvlPXtG1SvjVVRNkTAHaE_?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain" alt="Permaculture farm">
    <p>Permaculture designs agricultural systems that mimic natural ecosystems. It integrates crops, livestock, and trees to create sustainable and self-sufficient farms. This technique emphasizes harmony with nature and long-term productivity.</p>

    <h2>Agroforestry</h2>
    <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.8LWY-jT0HJU8nttqXS72WgHaEK?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain" alt="Agroforestry with trees and crops">
    <p>Agroforestry combines trees and crops in the same area. For example, coffee is often grown under the shade of banana trees. This method improves soil health, reduces erosion, and provides additional income for farmers.</p>

    <h2>Natural Pest Management</h2>
    <img src="https://i.ndtvimg.com/i/2017-02/pest-control_620x350_71487334766.jpg" alt="Ladybug for pest control">
    <p>Natural pest management uses biological methods to control pests. For instance, releasing ladybugs to combat aphids in cotton fields reduces the need for chemical pesticides. This eco-friendly approach promotes healthier crops and environments.</p>
